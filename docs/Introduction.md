## What is PlayQ?

**PlayQ** is an **AI-powered Test Automation Framework** built on **Playwright and TypeScript**, designed for enterprise-grade scalability, reusability, and resilience.

It bridges the gap between **UI, API, and data-driven testing**, combining the robustness of Playwright with intelligent automation through built-in **AI** and **Rule-based** engines:

**· PatternIQ** – Self-healing, pattern-based locators that eliminate brittle locator maintenance.

**· SmartAI** – DOM intelligence engine that interprets element hierarchy and labels to generate stable selectors.

**· DataGenIQ** – Synthetic data generator that produces realistic, domain-specific test data on demand.

PlayQ empowers teams to **automate complex digital platforms like Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM, Salesforce (TBD), and iValua (TBD)** with consistency, scalability, and reduced maintenance effort.

## Key Features


| **Capability**  | **Description** |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dual Execution Modes** | Supports both **Playwright Spec** tests and **Cucumber BDD (Gherkin)** tests within the same framework. |
| **AI/Pattern-Driven Locators** | PatternIQ & SmartAI engines eliminate flaky selectors by understanding page semantics, not just DOM nodes |
| **Data Intelligence** | DataGenIQ integrates dynamic, rule-based data generation for both UI and API layers. |
| **Unified Framework** | One setup for **UI, API, and data-driven testing** - no separate frameworks needed. |
| **Cross-Platform Add-ons** | Prebuilt connectors for enterprise platforms such as Dynamics 365 CRM, Salesforce, iValua and more. |
| **Reporting & Analytics** | Integrated with **Allure Reports, Playwright Report, Multiple Cucumber HTML Reporter** for video, screenshots, and trace visualization |
| **CI/CD Ready** | Works seamlessly with GitHub, Azure DevOps, Jenkins, and other CI pipelines. |


## Why PlayQ?

Traditional automation frameworks often struggle with fragile locators, poor scalability, and redundant test code.

PlayQ solves these issues with a **pattern-driven, AI-assisted architecture** that reduces maintenance and accelerates delivery.

|**Traditional Frameworks** | **PlayQ Advantages** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Hard-coded locators break with UI changes | PatternIQ patterns or SmartAI adapt automatically |
| Multiple frameworks for UI, API, and data | Unified platform with modular AI engines |
| High maintenance cost | Less than **3% locator updates** needed per UI change |
| Limited reusability | Modular step groups and reusable patterns |
| Manual test data setup | Synthetic, rule-based data generation |
| Poor reporting | Interactive Allure reports/ Multiple Cucumber HTML Reporter with artifacts |

**Result:** PlayQ helps teams ship faster with **70% lower maintenance effort, 2 to 3× faster test creation, and consistent application automation coverage.**
